# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this learning repository. A few simple guidelines make contributions fast and useful for everyone.

1. Fork the repository and work on a branch. Use descriptive branch names such as `fix/typo-vectors` or `add/probability-examples`.
2. Keep changes small and focused. Update or add unit-like checks (assertions) when changing numerical examples.
3. Add references when introducing new concepts, and include a short rationale in the PR description.
4. Prefer reproducible examples: set random seeds for any stochastic code, and keep visualizations deterministic where possible.
5. Run notebooks before opening a pull request. Use `jupyter nbconvert --execute` or run them interactively in Jupyter Lab.
6. For substantial additions (new chapters or exercises), open an issue first to discuss scope and learning objectives.

When your PR is ready:
- Link any related issues and describe the educational intent.
- Make sure code cells remain runnable and include notes about required packages.

Maintainers may request small changes before merging; follow review comments and iterate.
