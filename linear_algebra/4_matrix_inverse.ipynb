    "# A matrix can be thought of as a function that transforms a vector.\n",
    "# Example: A·X = B, where A is the transformation.\n",
    "# To undo the transformation and recover X from B, use the inverse A⁻¹: X = A⁻¹·B.\n",
    "# Multiplying by the inverse is like dividing by a number, but for matrices.\n",
    "# Only square matrices (n×n) can have inverses.\n",
    "# Non-singular matrices (determinant ≠ 0) have inverses.\n",
    "# Singular matrices (determinant = 0) do not have inverses.\n",
