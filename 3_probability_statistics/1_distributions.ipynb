    "# Distribution Definition\n",
    "# A distribution shows all possible values a variable can take and how frequently these values occur. For discrete variables, a probability mass function (PMF) assigns probabilities to countable outcomes; for continuous variables, a probability density function (PDF) describes probabilities across a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Distributions\n",
    "# Distributions are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discrete distributions (e.g. binomial, Poisson) describe countable outcomes like the number of website clicks per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continuous distributions (e.g. normal, exponential) apply to variables that can take any value within a range such as time spent on a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Properties\n",
    "# A distribution is defined by its parameters, such as mean, variance, or probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The total probability assigned to all possible outcomes always equals one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The shape of a distribution reflects how data is concentrated around certain values (central tendency), its spread (variance), and other characteristics such as symmetry or skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples\n",
    "# Binomial distribution: Used for countable, binary events like coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normal distribution: Applies to continuous variables, often resulting in the familiar bell-shaped curve for phenomena like heights or test scores.\n",
    "\n"
